# inventree_droplet
DigitalOcean Droplet for InvenTree. This repo includes the scripts needed to build the droplet.

## CI
This repo includes an action to build the droplet using packer (the command runs over 10 minutes - don't need that on my latop).  
There is a private repo that runs security checks after the action finishes. I migth open source that later.

## Listing
View the resulting listing on the [marketplace page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/inventree?refcode=d6172576d014) and consider deploying it from there. This link is a affiliate link - I might earn a comission if you decide to use the app in a base droplet for longer than 5 months.
You only need the most basic 5$ droplet to run this app - a bit more memmory might help but more than 4 GB is total overallocation - spend those ressources on something nice ðŸ˜‡.
